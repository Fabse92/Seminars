    abstract = {{A major goal of bio-inspired artificial intelligence is to design artificial neural networks with abilities that resemble those of animal nervous systems. It is commonly believed that two keys for evolving nature-like artificial neural networks are (1) the developmental process that links genes to nervous systems, which enables the evolution of large, regular neural networks, and (2) synaptic plasticity, which allows neural networks to change during their lifetime. So far, these two topics have been mainly studied separately. The present paper shows that they are actually deeply connected. Using a simple operant conditioning task and a classic evolutionary algorithm, we compare three ways to encode plastic neural networks: a direct encoding, a developmental encoding inspired by computational neuroscience models, and a developmental encoding inspired by morphogen gradients (similar to HyperNEAT). Our results suggest that using a developmental encoding could improve the learning abilities of evolved, plastic neural networks. Complementary experiments reveal that this result is likely the consequence of the bias of developmental encodings towards regular structures: (1) in our experimental setup, encodings that tend to produce more regular networks yield networks with better general learning abilities; (2) whatever the encoding is, networks that are the more regular are statistically those that have the best learning abilities.}},

  abstract = {One of the main limitations of scalability in
                 body-brain evolution systems is the representation
                 chosen for encoding creatures. This paper defines a
                 class of representations called generative
                 representations, which are identified by their ability
                 to reuse elements of the genotype in the translation to
                 the phenotype. This paper presents an example of a
                 generative representation for the concurrent evolution
                 of the morphology and neural controller of simulated
                 robots, and also introduces GENRE, an evolutionary
                 system for evolving designs using this representation.
                 Applying GENRE to the task of evolving robots for
                 locomotion and comparing it against a non-generative
                 (direct) representation shows that the generative
                 representation system rapidly produces robots with
                 significantly greater fitness. Analyzing these results
                 shows that the generative representation system
                 achieves better performance by capturing useful bias
                 from the design space and by allowing viable large
                 scale mutations in the phenotype. Generative
                 representations thereby enable the encapsulation,
                 coordination, and reuse of assemblies of parts.},

Paper Title: Effects of encoding on the general learning ability of artificial neural networks
Paper Author: Jan Fabian Schmid

A. Summary of the paper:
	- nice, go further in this kind of writing, it's really nice to read it


B. Strengths of the paper:
	- logical structure
	- well chosen figure

C. Weaknesses of the paper:
	- subparts in the introduction


D. Short evaluations

D1. Coverage of the Field:

D2. Depth of the topic:
	- Background is good referenced, so the reader can go deeper in the topic

D3. Structure:
	Abstract
		- not written yet
	1 Introduction 
		- Where do you know from that it is a "more prominent topic"?
		- "using artificial neural networks (ANNs). In contrast to artificial neural networks"
		-> there is a wrong vocabulary
		- maybe add in the first lines which paper/topic you are presenting (like the first paragraph of 1.2)
		1.1 Suggested solution
			- sounds more like a solution
			- maybe place this part somewhere else, because it's already part of the method description which doesn't have to be in the introduction
			- "Figure 1.1." - not the right number for the figure
		1.2 Goals and structure of this paper 
			- use the first sentence of this paragraph earlier in the paper, so that the reader get's an idea what he is about to read
			- For me, this section isn't needed as an own point, maybe make it just as a new paragraph
			- all the informations you give, are alredy available in the table of contents (Do you need this explanation for a paper of 10 pages?)
	2 Background Information 
		2.1 Regularity
			- very comprehensible 
			- the definition of the graph automorphisms doesn't seem to have a relation to the upper part.
			-> Maybe write it in a less mathematical way, or make the link to the upper part clearer
		2.2 From genes to nervous systems 
			2.2.1 Direct encoding
				- Are the seven mutation operators always used in this order? Otherwise don't use an enumeration.
				- Where did you get the mutation operators from? reference
				- Are this mutation operators based on some biological background?
				- If you name this part "Direct encoding" than the next part should name "developemental encodings"
			2.2.2 TODO: map-based encoding
				- not written yet
			2.2.3 TODO: HNN encoding
				- not written yet
		2.3 TODO: Skinner-box 
	3 TODO: related work 
		- "typically" you can't know if you have seen more than 75% of the papers related to this topic
	4 TODO: Approach description 
		- What kind of simplifications were made for this approach?
	5 TODO: Approach analysis 
		- plan looks logical
	6 TODO: Conclusion 
		- not written yet

D4. Quality of presentation / Clarity:
	- the parts which are already presented have a good content which is understandable without a deep understand of the topic

D5. Quality of the language:
	- nice to read, you don't get stuck because of complex sentence structures
	- length of the sentences is good (nice mixture of ong and short ones)

D6. Critical elaboration of the topic:

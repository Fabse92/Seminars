Paper Title: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
Paper Author: Cuong Nguyen Viet

A. Summary of the paper:
Reinforcement learning is a wide used utility for problem solving, but its application might be problematic.
Hierarchical reinforcement learning addresses this problem by breaking the problem into several low-level subproblems and solving them step by step.
HRL is considered as the learning mechanism used in nature.
Different approaches to HRL got developed, all having strengths and weaknesses.

B. Strengths of the paper:
- Some good illustrations
- extensive coverage of the field

C. Weaknesses of the paper:
- No introductions and summaries of chapters
- Some complicated math with very little motivation
- maybe too much content for one paper

D. Short evaluations
D1. Coverage of the Field:
Excellent: quite extensive, many related topics picked up

D2. Depth of the topic:
Excellent: everything well defined

D3. Structure:
Medium: Background given not only in the section provided therefor, but also in section 3 and 4. New concepts are still introduced in the discusson 

D4. Quality of presentation / Clarity:
Good: Much background provided, could be better structured and motivated

D5. Quality of the language:
Medium: mostly understandable, plenty of minor errors

D6. Critical elaboration of the topic:
Good: short but compact discussion

E. Detailed comments to the author:
You should consider to split the introduction into multiple subsections, like general introduction, problem statement and structure of the paper.
You could use the "itemize"-environment for example in 2.1 for defining the four main-sub-elements of RL.

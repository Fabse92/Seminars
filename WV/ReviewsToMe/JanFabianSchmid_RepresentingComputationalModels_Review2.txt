Paper Title: Examination of a framework for
multi-objective analysis of computational
models
Paper Author: Jan Fabian Schmid


A. Summary of the paper:

The paper aims to present and evaluate a framework of Doncieux et al, which is supposed to optimize the strategy to achieve multiple objectives.

B. Strengths of the paper:

Very clear motivation of both the paper and the issue


C. Weaknesses of the paper:

The paper uses very little information from outside the paper it is evaluating.

D. Short evaluations

D1. Coverage of the Field:

The paper is completely focused on the paper by Doncieux et al and could use outside sources to add perspectives, maybe those are to come in the TODO sections.

D2. Depth of the topic:

The in-depth analysis is still to come in the TODO sections so it is hard to comment on that

D3. Structure:

The structure does make sense, however it seems confusing at first. It is hard to tell by the structure where something is applicable to the general issue and 
it is specific to the discussed paper.

D4. Quality of presentation / Clarity:

There are no diagrams of concepts/relations but they could very much help to elaborate the topic.

D5. Quality of the language:

The quality of the language is okay.

D6. Critical elaboration of the topic:

As of yet it is only a collection of information without critical evaluation except for notes/keywords in TODO sections


E. Detailed comments to the author:
